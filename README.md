Object Orientated Programming Christmas Assignment - Game

The game that I chose to replicate was Asteroids.

Having chosen this game, I decided to replicate it to the best of my abilities, that being the mechanics of the game, the gameplay, etc., while still adding my own flair with a few upgrades.

The general aim of playing the game, to destroy the asteroids and alien spaceships and avoid crashing into them, remains the same in my version.
The main differences of my version of the game are the powerups. There are 7 powerups in total.
First being the double shooter, this is a simple powerup. When normally shooting lasers, they come from the front of the ship and move in the direction the ship is facing when they are fired. With this powerup, an additional laser is fired from the rear of the ship, moving in the opposite direction to the normal laser.
Second is the quad shooter, this extends the idea of the double shooter, in that in addition to the two lasers from the front and rear, an additional two lasers are fired from the sides of the ship, one in either direction, perpendicular to the direction of those fired by the double shooter.
